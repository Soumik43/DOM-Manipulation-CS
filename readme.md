# DOM Manipulation - Counter and Timer

The live link can be accessed here -> [Live link](https://soumik43.github.io/DOM-Manipulation-CS/)

This is a simple timer and counter application using DOM manipulation techniques.

The styling is functional and self explanatory.

The main application UI has a button for toggling the application to be displayed, based on the check-box selection the relevant application will be displayed on DOM.

##Folder structure

```
.
├── index.html
├── readme.md
├── src
│   ├── app.js
│   ├── counter
│   │   ├── counter.js/index.js
│   │   └── README.md
│   └── timer
│       ├── timer.js/index.js
│       └── README.md
└── style
    ├── counter.css
    ├── style.css
    └── timer.css
```

`index.html` doesn't contain any template, every manipulation is done with DOM.

`app.js` is the main application file that will work on displaying the contents on index.html file.

`counter.js` ➕ will build a counter component and `timer.js` ⏳ will build a timer component
